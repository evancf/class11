# Load data for clown fish body mass and sex. Examine the data.

# Plot clown fish body mass as a function of sex

# Add the data points on top of the plot

# Calculate the mean body mass for females

# Calculate the mean body mass for males

# Calculate the mean body mass for hermaphrodites

# Conduct a linear regression of fish body mass as a function of sex. 

# Examine a summary of the model

# What is the relationship between the intercept estimate and female body mass?

# What is the relationship between mean male body mass and the SexM estimate?

# What is the relationship between hermaphrodite body mass and the SexH estimate?

# What is the proportion of variance explained by the model? 

# TRUE OR FALSE? Body mass varies significantly based on sex 


# Load the data on milk quality and brain development. Examine the data

# Remove observations with missing values for neocortex.perc. Examine the dimensions

# Model milk kcal per gram as a function of neocortex size. 

# Examine the model summary

# Is this a bivariate model or a multivariate model?
# Is this a useful model? Why or why not?

# Now model milk kcal per gram as a function of log(body mass)
# Examine the model summary

# Is this a bivariate model or a multivariate model?
# Is this a useful model? Why or why not?

# Examine pairwise relationships between kcal per g, log(mass) and neocortex.perc

# What underlying relationship exists among these variables?

# Model milk kcal per gram as a function of log(body mass) and neocortex size
# Examine a summary of the model

# Is this a bivariate model or a multivariate model?
# Is this a useful model? Why or why not?

# Work through the code in "class11_plots.R" for plotting predicted values with
# confidence intervals and for plotting multivariate regression results for a single predictor
